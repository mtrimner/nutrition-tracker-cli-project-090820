# NutritionDataLookUp

Welcome to this Nutrition Data Lookup program. This project was developed as our for Flatiron School software engineering bootcamp. It allows users to search for foods using natural language. It will then produce an autofilled list of common foods, brand name foods, and restaurant items. This is done using the Nutritionix API through the CLI.

# How To Run The Program

-After you have cloned and opened the repo on our computer, enter ```ruby bin/run.rb``` in your terminal.

-A prompt will appear for you to search for a food. 

-Two lists will appear. One for common foods and one for branded products and restaurant items.

-The Common Foods list works best for generic items like chicken, steak, pork, etc.

-The Branded Foods list works best if you ate a specific product or had a meal at a well known restaurant.

-Once you select a number to the corresponding food, you will see a breakdown of the calories, carbs, total fat, and protein per serving.
